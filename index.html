                    Even though this is a unexpected year for school teachers they still made it work. They tried their best for this remote learning and this has actually worked. I feel I have improved through remote learning. some people might find this difficult but the teacher's are doing their best and we should appreciate them and all there hard work.

                    While there is a learning curve in shifting to remote learning, we found that there are also clear advantages. Overall, we found that students were more engaged and less distracted. In addition, technology tools also lend itself to scaling and better collaboration, which can be a plus in many scenarios.

                    Google Meet is becoming frustrating. first of all, They kick you out of meetings sayinging you have lost connection but your internet is perfectly fine. next is the video. sometimes your video turns of for no reason but it says on your screen that your cam is on. then comes something I have experienced, mic problems. Once my mic for google meet was not working. it said my microphone was on but my teachers coud not hear me. So the only way I could communicate was through the chat. So once I gave my teacher a call saying that my mic was not working, She told me call the tech support center and they said to get a new chromebook and then it started working. and finally your device starts lagging and and lagging.Google was having problems searching. For assignments it was difficult because if we had time at the end of class we would work on assignments. The assignments were from schoology and the assignments were on google docs so I thought there would not be any lag but I was wrong I had to keep refreshing my page over and over just to finally but by the time I had was already over. another big thing is when we have quizes we normally use kahoot or quiziz when I look back and fourth through the presentation the presentation is laggy. So when I am on question 5 the presentation will be on question 4. I hope the google meet glitches will go away soon.
